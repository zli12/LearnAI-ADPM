    "We finished the last Notebook by finding best fitting model using automated ML and registering it to our Azure ML account. In this Notebook, we deploy this model to an ACI instance and test it by scoring data against it. Scoring here happens in near-realtime, meaning that the data we score is pre-computed for us (such as a nightly batch job). Scoring can also happen in realtime, but as we will explore in a later Notebook, this requires more work. For predictive maintenance, realtime scoring is usually not needed, because models are used to predict when a machine is going to *about to* fail, which gives us some time to run unscheduled maintenance and replace parts."
